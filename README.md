# 🏡 Advanced Real Estate Valuation with Ensemble Regression Models
This project aims to build a robust and accurate real estate valuation model using ensemble regression techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, the model delivers precise property value predictions by learning from historical property sales, economic indicators, and neighborhood features.

## 📌 Project Highlights
Data Integration: Combines historical housing data, property features, and local socioeconomic indicators.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and normalizes features.

Ensemble Modeling: Implements and compares multiple regression models including:

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Voting Regressor (combination of above models)

Model Evaluation: Uses R² score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE to evaluate model performance.

Deployment Ready: Code is modular and can be extended for deployment in production or integrated into valuation platforms.

## 📁 Files

README.md: Project documentation (you’re reading it!).

requirements.txt: (Optional) List of required Python packages.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Pandas / NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn


## 📊 Results
The ensemble model (Voting Regressor) showed improved performance compared to individual regressors.

Feature importance plots highlight which property and location attributes drive prices the most.

Suitable for real-world deployment in real estate tech platforms.

## 🧠 Future Improvements
Incorporate geospatial data (latitude, longitude).

Integrate live economic indicators (e.g., interest rates).

Add explainability (SHAP values or LIME).

Web deployment using Flask or Streamlit.
